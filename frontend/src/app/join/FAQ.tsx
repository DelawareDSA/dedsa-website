          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What is Democratic Socialism?</h3>
          <p>
            Democratic socialism is a political philosophy that advocates for economic and social
            democracy alongside political democracy. We believe that both the economy and society
            should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How active do I need to be as a member?</h3>
          <p>
            Members participate at different levels based on their capacity. Some attend monthly
            meetings, others join a committee or working group, and some participate primarily
            online. We welcome any level of involvement you can offer, while encouraging active
            participation when possible.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Do I have to be a socialist to join?</h3>
          <p>
            You don&apos;t need to identify as a socialist to join DSA. Many members are still
            exploring their political beliefs. We welcome anyone who shares our commitment to
            building a more just and equitable society and is interested in learning more about
            socialist ideas and organizing.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How does my membership fee get used?</h3>
          <p>
            Membership dues fund DSA&apos;s national organization and local chapters like ours.
            Funds cover organizing materials, event spaces, political education resources, campaign
            literature, and supporting member attendance at national conventions and trainings.
