  "text_1": "What is Democratic Socialism?",
  "text_2": "Democratic socialism is a political philosophy that advocates for economic and social\n            democracy alongside political democracy. We believe that both the economy and society\n            should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few.",
  "text_3": "How active do I need to be as a member?",
  "text_4": "Members participate at different levels based on their capacity. Some attend monthly\n            meetings, others join a committee or working group, and some participate primarily\n            online. We welcome any level of involvement you can offer, while encouraging active\n            participation when possible.",
  "text_5": "Do I have to be a socialist to join?",
  "text_6": "You don't need to identify as a socialist to join DSA. Many members are still\n            exploring their political beliefs. We welcome anyone who shares our commitment to\n            building a more just and equitable society and is interested in learning more about\n            socialist ideas and organizing.",
  "text_7": "How does my membership fee get used?",
  "text_8": "Membership dues fund DSA's national organization and local chapters like ours.\n            Funds cover organizing materials, event spaces, political education resources, campaign\n            literature, and supporting member attendance at national conventions and trainings."
