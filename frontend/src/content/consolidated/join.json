        "question": "What is Democratic Socialism?",
        "answer": "Democratic socialism is a political philosophy that advocates for economic and social democracy alongside political democracy. We believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few."

        "question": "How active do I need to be as a member?",

We welcome any level of involvement you can offer, while encouraging active participation when possible."

      {
        "question": "Do I have to be a socialist to join?",
