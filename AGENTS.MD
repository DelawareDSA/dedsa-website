# Codex Instructions

- Run `./setup.sh` to install frontend dependencies.
- To execute checks use:
  - `npm run lint` in `frontend`
  - `npm run type-check` in `frontend`
  - `npm test` in `frontend` (currently a placeholder that always succeeds).
  - `npm outdated` in `frontend`
  - `npm update` in `frontend`
  - `npm run build` in `frontend`
  - `npm start` in `frontend`
- Codex should run these commands after code changes.
